# CV_Image_captioning
  This is the second project of the Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree. The project will create a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images. After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train the network, we will test it on novel images!
